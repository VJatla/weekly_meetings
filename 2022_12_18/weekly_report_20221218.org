* Feedback
- 
- Make the validation learning curves (loss and accuracy) smoother.
  1. Try the smoothing with default values used by tensorflow.
  2. Decrease the initial learning rate for adam optimizer.
  3. Create a datasplit to have more sessions in Testing and Validation. The
     recommendation is 50 for training, 30 for validation and 20 for testing.
