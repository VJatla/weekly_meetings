* Feedback
- 
- Make the validation learning curves (loss and accuracy) smoother.
  1. Try the smoothing with default values used by tensorflow.
  2. Decrease the initial learning rate for adam optimizer.
  3. Create a datasplit to have more sessions in Testing and Validation. The
     recommendation is 50 for training, 30 for validation and 20 for testing.
* Action items
- Smooth learning curves
- Decrease initial learning rate of 10FPS model
- Reshuffle data to have more sessions in testing and validation [0/2]
  - [ ] Summarize activity ground truth per 
- hand with pen / hand wihtout pen classifier [2/2]
  - [X] *Keras:* How to load dataset from directories?
  - [X] *Dataset:* Delete videos without hands in nowriting ground truth.

* Reshuffling dataset
- *Why?*
  - To have more sessions in Testing data.
  - To have smoother validation curve by having more sessions from same group
    in training and testing data.
* Hand with pen / Hand without pen classifier

** Dataset
- Hands with pen are extracted fron /writing/ video samples.
- Hands without pen are extracted fron /nowriting/ samples.
  -  Video samples that do not have hands are excluded.
- Per sample, which is 90 frames, we extract 30 frames. That is one frame for every 3 frames.
